# Student-Identification-System-QR-Code-Based-

## Developers Name :  Bashayer Alghamdi

## Short Introduction : 

University campuses serve as a microcosm of society, attracting individuals from diverse backgrounds who converge to pursue educational and professional endeavors. While this diversity can be advantageous, it also introduces intricate security challenges, potentially resulting in unauthorized access and identity theft. The project's motivation is to automate and modernize the current student identification within Al-Imam University by implementing a digital card containing a Quick Response Code (QR Code) and essential student information such as the student's name, ID, and picture. The project's significance lies in enhancing security, safeguarding university resources and assets against theft, and defending the campus from potential intruders. The project introduces a campus security solution. It enhances the student identification system by using a smart door to scan the QR code embedded in the digital card.
Moreover, it includes a system to monitor students' check-in and check-out activities, ensuring proper usage of their cards and preventing unauthorized attempts. The smart door features an LED indicator that activates based on the access status. This cutting-edge technology proactively safeguards our university campus by preventing unauthorized access, ensuring safety and security. In conclusion, the project enhances the campus experience for students by making the identification process faster and more convenient
